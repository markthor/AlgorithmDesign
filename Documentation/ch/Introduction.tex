\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Git}
The code is available on GitHub on the following link \url{https://github.com/markthor/AlgorithmDesign}

\subsection{Project aim}
The project aims to discover interesting facts about actors, movies, etc. using algorithms, with appropriate space and time requirements, to process the data provided by IMDb\footnote{Internet Movie Database, \url{www.imdb.com}}.

\subsection{Problem statement}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first problem is finding the most represented roles in a movie database, using a minimum amount of space. The representation of a role is defined as the percentage of times the role occurs among all roles of all movies.
	\item The second problem that the project aims to solve, is finding the Jaccard similarity of movie pairs, above a certain similarity threshold, using a minimum amount of time. The Jaccard similarity is based on a predefined subset of the movie attributes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Algorithmic solution}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The solution to the first problem will be based on the Misra Gries streaming algorithm. The problem is interpreted as a stream by viewing each genre of a single movie as a stream object.
	\item The solution to the second problem is calculated using locality sensitive hashing with minhashing of shingles relevant to movie data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem scope}
For the first problem, the space consumption is measured by the auxiliary space that the algorithm use. The data stream will consume some space, which is not a part of this measurement.

\subsection{Problem setting}
The data to be analysed is a dataset produced by IMDb. The data set is constructed to be loaded into a database and contains a lot of information about movies, actors, etc. However it is not all data which is relevant for the problem, so the dataset have been cleaned for all uneccesary data and a new datafile only containing roles from movies is created and used.
