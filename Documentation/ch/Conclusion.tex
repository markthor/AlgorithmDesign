\section{Conclusion}
The problem of finding the most represented roles has been solved using Misra Gries and reservoir sampling. Both solutions uses a sublinear amount of space, but they introduce different problems. Misra Gries returns a large amount of false positives for the concrete problem instance, which makes it difficult to tell exactly which roles that are the most represented for a small \(\alpha\). Reservoir sampling uses less space if a certain uncertainty can be accepted.\\ \\
The problem of finding the most similar movies has been solved using locality-sensitive hashing. The algorithm successfully reduces the running time to less than quadratic. However the movie data from the data set is not high-dimensional, which results in the number of permutations for Min Hashing being low. Therefore LSH is left with a low number of bands and rows, which is a sub-optimal setting. In a problem setting with a higher number of dimensions, the solution would yield more impressive result.
