\section{Conclusion}
The problem of finding the most represented roles has been solved using Misra Gries and reservoir sampling. Both solutions uses a sublinear amount of space, but they introduce different problems. Misra Gries returns a large amount of false positives for the concrete problem instance, which makes it difficult to tell exactly which roles that are the most represented for a small \(\alpha\). Reservoir sampling can also return false positives as well not return elements that should be reported, i.e. false negatives. The more uncertainty acceptable the less space the algorithm uses.\\

The problem of finding the most similar movies has been solved using locality-sensitive hashing. The algorithm successfully reduces the running time to less than quadratic. However the movie data from the data set is not high-dimensional, which results in the number of permutations for Min Hashing being low. Therefore LSH\footnote{Locality-sensitive hashing} is left with a low number of bands and rows, which is a sub-optimal setting. In a problem setting with a higher number of dimensions, the solution would yield more impressive result.
